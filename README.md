## ðŸš€ About Me
Hello! Iâ€™m Timurhan. Iâ€™m 17 years old, and Iâ€™ve been fascinated by computers and software since childhood. Iâ€™ve constantly strived to improve myself in this field. During high school, I focused on repairing computers, smart boards, and dealing with operating systems. I also took care of maintaining the schoolâ€™s servers and spent a lot of time in the system room. Additionally, I participated in several TÃœBÄ°TAK (Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) events at school. However, recently, Iâ€™ve felt less drawn to software development. As a result, Iâ€™ve distanced myself from programming a bit. Nevertheless, I still thoroughly enjoy tinkering with computer hardware. My future plan is to start my own business and continue developing myself in this field.
